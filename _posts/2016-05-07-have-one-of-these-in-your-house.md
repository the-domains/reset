Have one of these in your house?

You're likely trippin' most of the time, especially if it's your first.

Security means everything. The check's need to come in on a regular basis. That means you need to keep your head down, stay stable, don't get cute at the office.

That is probably the worst thing you can do - to shift into neutral.

The stuff you know how to do will keep those checks coming in - from your clients. Payday might be two or three days a week sometimes. 

Don't trip. We'll remind you how to do it, then you will.
