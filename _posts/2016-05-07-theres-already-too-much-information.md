There isn't. 

You are helping yourself, but this ain't self-help. We are professionals, not prophets.

This is about making money with the skills you possess - the things you like to do and the things you are good at doing. What RESET will do is simply guide you along your own process. You do the work, you take the credit. You, for the win.
