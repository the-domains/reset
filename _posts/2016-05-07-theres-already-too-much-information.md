# Too Much

Think of all the blahblahblah about "being happy." We are not offering 5-step programs to happiness. That would assume there's something wrong with you.

There isn't. You're good. And nobody's 5-step anything is the cure to make you a better person. It's all a lie, by an industry obsessed with draining your purse and wallet of the money that's been so hard to come by. 

We're not self-help. we're a partner in your success. Make up your own 5-step plan. Now we're with you.

# Too Little, Not Helpful

You are helping yourself, but this ain't self-help. We are professionals, not prophets.

This is about making money with the skills you possess - the things you like to do and the things you are good at doing. What RESET will do is simply guide you along your own process. You do the work, you take the credit. You, for the win.
