**What's Next?**

You walk up to the building you work at, you look up...and sigh. This place is a prison of sorts. They have you captive. You're smothering, feeling claustrophobic. This is in your head, but you're not crazy. You want something else. Why are you stalling? It's a race - one day they'll be done with you, and you'll be a walking cliche. Box in hand, coffee cup, a few pictures inside it. And you'll wonder: w_hat now? What's next?_

That's what we are here for. 

Everybody knows how to get a job, at least most of us do. The rules of networking have been digitized, but it's pretty much the same as it always has been. We're not going to be about that. We know how to help people manage their portfolio of skills and use them for income generation for life.
